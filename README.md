# Module 7 Challenge
## Create a Web Application for an ETF Analyzer

In recent years, finance has had an explosion in passive investing. Passive investing means that you invest in a basket of assets that’s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification.
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook that contains analysis of the ETF data that a SQL database stores and professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations as well as screenshots of the web application created by deploying Jupyter notebook via the Voilà library.


## Technologies
This project is written in python. The required libraries in order to use the application are numpy, pandas, hvplot.pandas, sqlalchemy, and inspect from sqlalchemy
